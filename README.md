# Diabetes-Health-Indicators
Objective: The project aims to harness the extensive dataset from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to create an insightful Power BI dashboard. This visual tool will effectively present and analyze key risk factors associated with diabetes and related chronic health conditions. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between demographic characteristics and health-related aspects influencing diabetes.

Project Flow:
1.	Dataset Cleaning (Microsoft Excel):
• The initial data cleaning and pre-processing steps were performed in Microsoft 
Excel to handle any missing or inconsistent values. 
• Once the data was prepared, further analysis and visualization were conducted using 
Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.	Data Analysis (Python):
•	Conducted an in-depth analysis of the cleaned dataset using Python.
•	Explored various attributes and assessed their correlation with diabetes prevalence.
•	Utilized matrix analysis to identify key factors, leading to the conclusion that Age and BMI exhibit significant correlation with diabetes.
3.	Power BI Dashboard:
•	Integrated insights from Python analysis into the development of the Power BI dashboard.
•	Prioritized visualizations highlighting the predominant correlation between BMI, Age, and diabetes.
•	Ensured the dashboard serves as a comprehensive and intuitive tool for understanding the intricate relationships within the dataset.

Insights from the Power BI Dashboard:
1. BMI Category 4 (30-39.9):
• Individuals with BMI in the range of 30-39.9 show a pronounced tendency towards 
diabetes.
• Highest prevalence observed within the age bracket of 65-69.
2. Age and Diabetes Connection:
• A substantial portion of the population experiences diabetes between the ages of 
65-69.
• Noteworthy association between diabetes and BMI in the 30-39.9 range during this 
age range.
3. Gender Disparity:
• Females exhibit a higher prevalence of diabetes compared to males in the dataset.
• Understanding and addressing gender-specific factors is crucial for effective health 
interventions.
4. High-Risk Demographic:
• The intersection of age 65-69 and BMI category 4 (30-39.9) signifies a high-risk 
demographic for diabetes.
• Targeted health initiatives may be particularly impactful for this group
