# Diabetes-Health-Indicators
Objective: The project aims to harness the extensive dataset from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to create an insightful Power BI dashboard. This visual tool will effectively present and analyze key risk factors associated with diabetes and related chronic health conditions. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between demographic characteristics and health-related aspects influencing diabetes.

Project Flow:
1.	Dataset Cleaning (Python):
•	Employed Python for initial dataset cleaning to ensure data integrity.
•	Addressed inconsistencies and anomalies to prepare a reliable dataset for analysis.
2.	Data Analysis (Python):
•	Conducted an in-depth analysis of the cleaned dataset using Python.
•	Explored various attributes and assessed their correlation with diabetes prevalence.
•	Utilized matrix analysis to identify key factors, leading to the conclusion that Age and BMI exhibit significant correlation with diabetes.
3.	Power BI Dashboard:
•	Integrated insights from Python analysis into the development of the Power BI dashboard.
•	Prioritized visualizations highlighting the predominant correlation between BMI, Age, and diabetes.
•	Ensured the dashboard serves as a comprehensive and intuitive tool for understanding the intricate relationships within the dataset.
